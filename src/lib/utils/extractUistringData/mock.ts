Hmm... I can tell, even if you don't show it. You were unable to get the wisdom this absolute best unequaled creator bequeathed. But the wisdom bequeathed by me, the greatest genius ever, could never be understood by a kid like yourself. However, I am magnanimous. I've left you further wisdom. Try to get your hands on it.

There's a team gladiatorial match happening these days. You have to kill Sandworms and turrets to destroy each other's flags and develop as fighters. To win this thrilling match, you need to work well together rather than make use of raw skill. Why don't you give it a try?

There's a team gladiatorial match happening these days. You have to kill Sandworms and turrets to destroy each other's flags and develop as fighters. To win this thrilling match, you need to work well together rather than make use of raw skill. Why don't you give it a try? Teamwork is key, so head over to #yLabyrinth 9F+#d, find the #ySerpentra Nest#d, and clear it out as a #yparty of 4#d. I'm sure you'll have a great time.]]></message>

I've finished subjugating the galaxy and returned to Alteia. Seeing my brilliance across the entire galaxy was quite pleasing. Hehe... Now the only thing left is divinity. This may be my greatest challenge yet. Until we meet again! I'm off to prepare for dinner with Argenta! You'll find my last bits of wisdom deep inside the #yManticore Nest#d starting with #yLabyrinth 8F+#d! Of course there's no way you could do it alone.

Friendless people like to claim they're doing well, but they tend to fall into multi-level marketing, cults, that kind of thing. I know there are some people like that within the Dragon Followers as well. It's really pathetic. You have friends, right?

We had dinner together and I bought her cute headbands and clothes, but she left me. Everyone teased me and said she was playing the field, but I can't believe it. Surely she... Everyone pities someone who spends every day alone, so she must have gone to form a party. Please... Please tell me everyone goes as part of a #yparty of 4#d to beat dungeons. It's not always with a lover. Right??? If I were to see someone beat a #yChiron Nest#d from #yLabyrinth 7F+#d, it would be such great consolation to me.]]></message>

There was an argument in a pub I often visit. There was a heated discussion about whether or not it's possible to beat a #yTyphoon Kim Nest#d in #yLabyrinth 6F+#d. I said it's a little-known fact that it can be beaten, but no one believed me. If someone other than me went and cleared that nest, I'd be proven right. It's a very dangerous place, so you'd better go as a #yparty of 4#d.]]></message>

No one should live alone, and it makes me cry to see anyone hunting alone, either. I can't bear it. Adventures should be shared with friends! Isn't that right? So I'm asking you to take some friends to beat the #yProfessor K Nest#d at #yLabyrinth 6F+#d. What? Don't you have any friends? Surely you're not out there adventuring by yourself?

There's a team gladiatorial match happening these days. You have to kill Sandworms and turrets to destroy each other's flags and develop as fighters. To win this thrilling match, you need to work well together rather than make use of raw skill. Why don't you give it a try? Teamwork is key, so head over to #yLabyrinth 6F+#d, find the #ySerpentra Nest#d, and clear it out as a #yparty of 4#d. I'm sure you'll have a great time.]]></message>

Lately I’ve been dreaming about ten thousand potatoes running around in all directions
and I can’t wake up unless I chop them all up.
I’m so tired... Soon I’ll have the worst dark circles under my eyes!
Huh? They aren’t potatoes, they’re seed ants… What?
Whatever, just chop them up for me tonight, please.

This is trouble. The Goddess's Nightmare is evolving unabated.
Even normal people are being influenced by the nightmare.
Could it be the fault of this byway connecting to Mistland?
I have an ominous premonition. I cannot destroy the byway,
so I need you to purify this nightmare, quickly.
